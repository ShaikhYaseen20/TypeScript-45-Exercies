/*Assignment Number 35. Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these
animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. • Modify your program to print a
statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program
stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would
make a great pet! */

let animalsName = ["Cow", "Goat","Sheep", "Camel"]

// print only names
for(let i of animalsName){
    console.log(i)
}

for(let j of animalsName){
    console.log(`${j} is a Domestic Animal`)
}

console.log(`All these animals' ${animalsName[0]}, ${animalsName[1]}, ${animalsName[2]} and ${animalsName[3]} meat is Halal in Islam`)
